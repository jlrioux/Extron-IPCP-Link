    HANDSHAKE
        wait for passcode recieve. send accepted ack when proper passcode comes in.
        synchronizing flag true
    RECEIVE DEVICE AND INTERFACE LIST
        - all are recieved as a list of formatted aliases with a closing sequence.
            - ex: device-list:["device alias"]:device-list-complete
        - ipcp returns a list of unknown ones and control server then sends details for unkonwn ones to be defined.
        - ipcp responds with interface package complete message once all objects are created in this catagory
        device package -
            ui devices : as these are defined, raise synchronizing page if applicable
            processors,
            spd devices
        ebus devices - this is separate as they depend on a processor being defined
            - all are recieved as a list of formatted aliases with a closing sequence.
                - ex: device-list:["host alias:device alias"]:device-list-complete
            - ipcp creates undefined ebus objects as needed, sends done message when complete
        interface package -
            - all are recieved as a list of formatted aliases with a closing sequence.
                - ex: device-list:["host alias:port"]:device-list-complete
            - ipcp returns a list of unknown ones and control server then sends details for unkonwn ones to be defined.
            - ipcp responds with interface package complete message

        - further UI details must be synchronized per UI. this can be in batches of 200 or so
            - all button ids.  ex: "alias-buttons-list:[1,2,3,4,5]:alias-buttons-list-done"
                - ipcp then returns a list of unregistered button ids
                - server sends a dictionary of unkonwn button ids with non-default parameters.  ex: alias-buttons-params:{1:{'hold':3,'repeat':0.5},4:{'hold':1}}:alias-buttons-params-done
                - ipcp defines all unknown buttons with all handlers with compiled details

                - ipcp defines all uknown labels
            - all levels ids.  ex: "alias-levels-list:[1,2,3,4,5]:alias-levels-list-done"
                - ipcp then returns a list of unregistered level ids
                - server sends a dictionary of unkonwn level ids with non-default parameters.  ex: alias-levels-params:{1:{'max':3,'min':0,'step':2},4:{'max':1,'min':-10}}:alias-levels-params-done

            - all knob ids.  ex: "alias-knobs-list:[1,2,3,4,5]:alias-knobs-list-done"
    synchronizing modal on panel can go away

"""
NOTES FOR UI
"""
In all touch panels, there should be two modal popups besides the project's pages.
1. Control Server is Offline
2. Synchronizing Project
The UI should return to the project's pages when syncronization is done.
While the control server is offline, popup 1 will be reinforced every 5 seconds
While the the ipcp is synchronizing with the control, popup 2 will be reinforced every 5 seconds


"""
Architecture
"""

- an IPCP side ipserver that listens for control server connections and starts initialize process on connection
    - a master class that acts as traffic cop for messages between the control server and wrapped extronlib classes.

- each extronlib class will have a wrapper class that reimplements it with additions to include reporting to server.
    - the wrapper class will inherit from a wrapper_master class with methods used to pass messages back and forth to control
